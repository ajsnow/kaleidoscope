(In progress) Go port of LLVM's Kaleidoscope Tutorial

For now, just my code implimenting it. Once I know a little bit more about llvm, I'll "port" the text as well.

===============

* [LLVM's Official C++ Kaleidoscope Tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/LangImpl1.html)

* If you wanted to impliment your own lexer, [Rob Pike's *Lexical Scanning in Go*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxaD_trXwRE) is a good starting point for building an interesting, idiomatic Go lexer/parser pair.
